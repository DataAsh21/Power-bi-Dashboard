#### Project Description: Data Cleaning and Dashboard Creation
-  Introduction:
The objective of this project is to create a dashboard that provides the client with insights into their retail sales data. The primary focus of the project is to remove blanks or empty values from the data set and create a 2-page dashboard that displays the data in a clear and concise manner. The dashboard will include a sales dashboard and a details page, which can be navigated using a page navigator. Several filters will be included on the dashboard to enable users to explore the data based on their specific requirements.
-  Project Scope:
The scope of the project includes the following tasks:
-  Data Cleaning:
The first step of the project is to clean the data set by removing blanks or empty values from the data set. The cleaned data set will be used to create the dashboard.
-  Dashboard Design:
The dashboard will be designed in two parts: a sales dashboard and a details page. The sales dashboard will provide an overview of the sales data, including sales and profit by segment and order priority by sales. The details page will provide a more detailed view of the data and include a filter for the order date. The page navigator will be used to enable users to navigate between the two pages.
-  Filters:
Several filters will be included on the dashboard based on the client's requirements. The filters will include a list filter for market and segment, a filter for order date labeled as "Choose Date", a highlight of the top 5 customers by sales, profit by sales displayed on a map, profit by year and quarter displayed on a line chart, a card for total ship price, a list country filter based on the country column in the data set, and a drill-through approach for sales by category and region.


-  Conclusion:
The Data Cleaning and Dashboard Creation project involves removing blanks or empty values from the data set and creating a 2-page dashboard with a sales dashboard and a details page. The dashboard includes several filters based on the client's requirements and can be navigated using a page navigator. The project aims to provide the client with insights into the underlying trends and patterns in the data and enable them to make informed decisions based on the data.
